kdb+ client library in Haskell.

Status
------
- [X] [Parser and serializer](https://github.com/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell/issues/) for most kdb+ types is implemented with good test coverage.

Plans/Open Issues
-----------------
- [ ] [q parser](https://github.com/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell/issues/5) - I would like to be able to parse q into an ast 
  to see if it is possible to add some type checking and inference.
- [ ] [ToKDB/FromKDB](https://github.com/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell/issues/6)
- [ ] [Add remaining types](https://github.com/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell/issues/8)
- [ ] [Move IO code from tests](https://github.com/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell/issues/9)
- [ ] [Export public API](https://github.com/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell/issues/10)
