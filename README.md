[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/jkozlowski/kdb-haskell)

kdb+ driver in Haskell.

Status:
* Parser and serializer for most kdb+ types is implemented with good test coverage.

Plans:
* q parser - I would like to be able to parse q into an ast 
  to see if it is possible to add some typing and type inference.
